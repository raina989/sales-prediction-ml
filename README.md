# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning 🤖

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict sales based on historical transaction data. The goal is to understand how basic features such as quantity, discount, and seasonality influence sales performance.

## Objective
- Build a machine learning model to predict sales
- Evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics
- Visualize actual vs predicted sales values

## Dataset
Sample Superstore Dataset (Kaggle)

## Features Used
- Quantity
- Discount
- Month

## Model Used
- Linear Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R² Score

## Results
The model captures general sales trends and provides a baseline for predicting sales. While predictions are not perfect, the model demonstrates how historical data can be used to estimate future sales.

## Visualizations
- `actual_vs_predicted.png` – Scatter plot comparing actual sales values with model predictions.

## Future Improvements
- Include categorical features using encoding
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Perform feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning
